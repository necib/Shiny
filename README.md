# Shiny Application 
## Motor Trend Analysis

In this directory you find a small shiny application which plots the variable mpg against others (cyl, am, gear and carb).
You can run this application directly  from the server shinyapps.io (https://www.shinyapps.io/necib/#/applications/)or load the code in your RStudio and deploy it.
